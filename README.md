Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=xamidi&color=ff0000" width="0" height="0"/>

I am Samiro, a German mathematician in theoretical computer science working mostly independently on deontic logic and proof theory, currently focussing on proof minimization in Hilbert systems. I studied and graduated in computer science at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), which now supports [some](https://xamidi.github.io/pmGenerator/) of my work in the form of computing time projects.

- ðŸ”­ Do you see the beauty in Hilbert systems? Then you might want to join my [proof minimization challenge](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/2)! âœ¨
- ðŸ‘¯ I am involved with Metamath's [mmsolitaire](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/mms.html) project and its [shortest known proofs database](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/pmproofs.txt).
- ðŸ’« I am enthusiastic about modern and well-written C++, especially in the context of high-performance computing.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/1) about any of my interests mentioned here.
- ðŸš« I do not jump on hype trains for languages that compromise freedom, beauty and productivity for safety.
- ðŸ¤” Having Asperger's syndrome, I am neither flexible in my interests, nor willing to compromise my areas of work for money, prestige, or a career. So until I find people with similar interests, I will keep working on my own projects in solitude.
