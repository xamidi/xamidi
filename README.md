Welcome! <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f44b.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ‘‹"></picture></sub> <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=xamidi&color=ff0000" width="0" height="0" alt="">

I am Samiro, a German mathematician in theoretical computer science working mostly independently on deontic logic and proof theory, currently focussing on proof minimization in Hilbert systems. I studied and graduated in computer science at [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de), which now supports [some of my work](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator) in the form of computing time projects.

Then you might want to join my [proof minimization challenge](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/2)! <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/2728.svg" width="16" alt="âœ¨"></picture></sub>
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f46f.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ‘¯"></picture></sub> I am involved with Metamath's [mmsolitaire](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/mms.html) project and its [shortest known proofs database](https://us.metamath.org/mmsolitaire/pmproofs.txt).
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f4ab.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ’«"></picture></sub> I am enthusiastic about modern and well-written C++, especially in the context of high-performance computing.
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f4ac.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ’¬"></picture></sub> Feel free to [contact me](https://github.com/xamidi/pmGenerator/discussions/1) about any of my interests mentioned here.
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f6ab.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸš«"></picture></sub> I do not jump on hype trains for languages that compromise freedom, beauty and productivity for safety.
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f525.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ”¥"></picture></sub> Some scammers are attempting to defame me, angered by things like [this repository](https://github.com/xamidi/github-followership-scammers). For example, u/xamidi on Reddit is *not* my account. All claims that I would engage in irrational behavior like femboyism, wokism or pro-war activism should be considered lies.
- <sub><picture><img src="twemoji/1f914.svg" width="16" alt="ðŸ¤”"></picture></sub> Having Asperger's syndrome, I am neither flexible in my interests, nor willing to compromise my areas of work for money, prestige, or a career. So until I find people with similar interests, I will keep working on my own projects in solitude.
